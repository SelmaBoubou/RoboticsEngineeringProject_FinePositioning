# Visual Servoing
 The use of information acquired by vision sensors (cameras) for feedback control of the pose/motion of a robot (or of parts of it).
 
 **Some applications:**
 1. Automatic navigation of robotic systems (agricolture, automotive) 
 2. Surveillance
 3. Bio-motion synchronization (surgical robotics)
 
 
  **Techniques**
  1. Pose-Based Visual Servoing
  2. Image-Based Visual Servoing
  3. 2.5 D Visual Servoing
  4. Shortest-Path Visual Servoing
 

## Objectives:
- Research on the different techniques (refer to the survey report)
- Simulate and choose the more accurate technique
- Implement it
