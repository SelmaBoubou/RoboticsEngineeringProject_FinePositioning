# Visual Servoing
 This technical survey report was for us to get introduce to the field of visual servoing and methods to solve our task.
 Visual Servoing also known as vision-based robot control is method which uses feedback information acquired by vision sensors (cameras) to control the pose/motion of a robot (or parts of it). Its techniques are commonly used for positioning a robot in a desired position or following a target in movement.

 **Some applications:**
 1. Automatic navigation of robotic systems (agricolture, automotive) 
 2. Surveillance
 3. Bio-motion synchronization (surgical robotics)
 
 
  **Techniques**
  1. Pose-Based Visual Servoing
  2. Image-Based Visual Servoing
  3. 2.5 D Visual Servoing
  4. Shortest-Path Visual Servoing
 

## Objectives:
- Research on the different techniques (refer to the survey report)
- Simulate and choose the more accurate technique
- Implement it
