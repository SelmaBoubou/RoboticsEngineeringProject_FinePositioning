# Introduction

This project is for our course module Robotics Engineering. 
It is subdivided into different parts, each group is supposed to implement is own part and at the end make a fully autonomous scenario. 

The channel is at follows:
1. Navigation
2. Mapping & Localization
3. Fine Positioning 
4. Pick & Place
5. Mapping & Localization

Our part is based on the 3rd channel (Fine Positioning). Using Visual Servoing techniques our robot must find the position of the target autonomously.
We describe in a brief survey report the different methods of visual servoing.
