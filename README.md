# Introduction

This project is for our course module Robotics Engineering. 
It is subdivided into different parts, each group is supposed to implement is own part and at the end make a fully autonomous scenario. 

The channel is at follows:
1. Navigation
2. Mapping & Localization
3. Fine Positioning 
4. Pick & Place
5. Mapping & Localization

Our part is based on the 3rd channel (Fine Positioning). Using Visual Servoing techniques our robot must find the position of the target autonomously.
We describe in a brief survey report the different methods of visual servoing.

# Problem Statement
Given any location of the robot(Turtlebot2) we are to position it at a specific location known as the loaded area. We are to exatcly put the Turtlebot2 in a postion where the robotic arm will be able to pick the cube and place it on the Turtlebot2.

# Objectives
1. Create a Map
2. Navigate within the map 
3. Go to specific location 
4. Detect and track the tag
5. Move to the exact location of the tag

# Implementation
We accomplished each task of the objectives stated in order to give solution the Problem Statement. The first three steps were just a basic step for us since we had hand experience with this during our Bachelor year.

If this is your first time being on this ros platform please follow the steps we provided and assisted videos which will help in the accomplishing the first three steps. We believe you will be able to have a hand in identifying the Problem Statement and you will also have a creative idea for solving it as well we did. as we did.
