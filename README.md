# Fine Positioning (Visual Servoing)

This project is for our course module Robotics Engineering. 
It is subdivided into different parts, each group is supposed to implement is own part and at the end make a fully autonomous scenario. 

The channel is at follows:
1. Navigation
2. Mapping & Localization
3. Fine Positioning 
4. Pick & Place
5. Mapping & Localization

Our part is based on the 3rd channel (Fine Positioning). Using Visual Servoing techniques our robot must find the position of the target autonomously.
We describe in a brief survey report the different methods of visual servoing.

## Visual Servoing
 The use of information acquired by vision sensors (cameras) for feedback control of the pose/motion of a robot (or of parts of it).
 
 **Some applications**
 1. Automatic navigation of robotic systems (agricolture, automotive) 
 2. Surveillance
 3. Bio-motion synchronization (surgical robotics)
 
 
  **Techniques**
  1. Pose-Based Visual Servoing
  2. Image-Based Visual Servoing
  3. 2.5 D Visual Servoing
  4. Shortest-Path Visual Servoing
 

## Project Objectives:
- Research on the different techniques (refer to the survey report)
- Simulate and choose the more accurate technique
- Implement it
- Make a full scenario with the other teams group
